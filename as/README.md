# G15 Assembler
Here begins my attempt to write a somewhat usable assembler for the Bendix G15

# Bendix G15 Architecture 
The big issue with this project has to do with the esoteric design on the Bendix G15. A combination of 50â€™s technology, reduced part count, and clever design makes it extremely difficult to write a standard tool chain. Drum memory computers are an interesting offshoot of computing history, but it is not hard to figure out why they were an architectural dead end.

Going forward, I will use this space both as documentation and as a place to plan how exactly this piece of software is going to go together. The Bendix G15 documentation does not even have opcodes for all of the instructions.
